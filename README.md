## About

"Fork This" tells the story of a designer who codes - me, Miuki Miu.

When I started coding, I used to think my code was never good enough. 
Now, I believe that doing is what matters. 

“Fork This” aims to encourage women to follow their passion.
Overcoming imposter syndrome is a struggle, but if you just keep going, you can achieve anything you want. You can DESIGN, CODE, DESIGN and CODE, or more!

Aaaaaand... If you’re into music and want to give it a try:
- Make your own remix 
- Make your own lyrics

Just fork the project and submit your versioooooonn!!!!

Have fun, 
Miuki Miu - *the DESIGNER who CODES.
